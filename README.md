# An Analysis of Housing and Rental Growth Trends in San Francisco Neighborhoods

This project investigates whether San Francisco is a suitable pilot city for a new one-click, buy-and-rent service. The analysis considers variables such as total housing units, sale price per ftÂ², and gross rent in order to formulate its conclusion. 

## Technologies

This project utilizes python 3.7 and the following packages:

[jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/)

[numpy](https://numpy.org/)

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[pyviz](https://pyviz.org/)

[holoviews](http://holoviews.org/)

[geoviews](https://geoviews.org/)

The project has been constructed in a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook entitled `san_francisco_housing.ipynb`.

## Installation Guide

To clone the repository to your computer, first make sure you are using python version 3.7 or greater by typing the following:

`python -V`

Next, confirm that the packages are installed by using the following code lines:

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install pyviz`

`pip install hvplot`

`pip install geoviews`

`pip install jupyterlab`

## Usage

In order to view the project, navigate to the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook in the repository directory. If you cannot find the file, simply click [here](https://github.com/MaxAcheson/Module_6_Challenge/blob/main/Starter_Code/san_francisco_housing.ipynb) instead. If you would like to interact with the live version of the analysis, you may navigate to your cloned version of the repository in your terminal and run `jupyter lab`.

Since Holoviews figures do not render live on GitHub, the figures from the analysis have been provided below, along with their corisponding notebook cell.
